            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> During current times of rapid advancements in all fields and continuous existence on the bleeding edge of technology, there remains a need for education that encompasses these factors	with the skill and insight for groundbreaking applications of these advancements. The Bachelor of Innovation™ (BI) fills this void with a growing family of educational disciplines that yield sought after innovation leaders who excel equally as leaders and members of a team.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"><strong>BI students are people that embody innovation and transform ideas into impact.</strong> </p>
            <img src="img/uccsBiLogoNoBackgroundf.png" alt="description of image">
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> The Bachelor of Innovation program at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs(UCCS) currently offers 19 BI majors spanning arts, business, education, engineering, and applied sciences. While it may be difficult to find commonality among all areas and subareas of these educational majors, they are bound by the Innovation Core. The Innovation Core is the heart of the BI, it is a series of courses that instills the ideas of, and trains the minds of BI students in, new methods of looking at and analyzing problems, solutions generation, and teamwork strategies. Routing students through a pipeline of technicalwriting, entrepreneurship, business law, and a series of team-based classes allows BI students to separate themselves from traditional college students.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">Students of the BI work as consultants with businesses in the "Teams" class series; these businesses collaborate with a group of students all in different stages of their academic career and all working through different BI majors. The Teams class is a series of three classes in which a student will gather experience at three different levels of team membership. During the first iteration, the student will be inexperienced, and this will be the first exposure to working in an innovation team as a consultant for a real-world client. The second iteration allows the student to function as an experienced team member, assisting the team leader, and helping guide new team members through the process. For the final iteration, the student assumes the role of a team leader. During this period the student will be the primary connection between the client and the team, ensuring that the client’s desires are properly relayed to the team for successful execution, maintaining productivity and motivation, and being a primary influence towards team success. It is the cumulative experience of the series of Teams classes that help separate a BI student from the masses of traditional students.
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> The BI releases new graduates into the economy that are leaps and bounds beyond their recent graduate peers; having already gained years of real-world experience working within multiple realms of the professional world through consulting for and working alongside existing businesses to generate new ideas and strategies for accelerating the success of these businesses. The BI is not the journey taken by your standard employee; the BI is the less-traveled path for the mind that will not settle for the status quo, the personality that will not be content until it has impacted the lives of those near and far, for the person who can change the world.
